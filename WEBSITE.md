> Premium embroidery digitizing, vector art, and custom patches SaaS platform with a public marketing site, client portal, and admin operations workspace.

---

## Executive Summary (What the website currently includes)

GenX Digitizing is a full-stack production platform with three major surfaces:

1. **Public marketing site** for discovery, service education, pricing, portfolio, and lead/contact capture.
2. **Client portal** for quotes, orders, invoices, file delivery, and support chat.
3. **Admin/staff workspace** for operations: order production, billing, support, marketing, notifications, and audit trails.

### Core user journey

- Visitor lands on the public site, reviews services/portfolio/pricing, and submits a quote or order.
- Authenticated client tracks order progress, approves proofs, pays invoice, and downloads final files.
- Staff processes orders, uploads outputs, verifies payment proofs, and unlocks file delivery.

### What this document includes

- Every major route (public, auth, client, admin)
- Key UI modules and workflow states
- API map for frontend/backend integration
- Data model overview and role-based access
- Integrations (S3/R2, Resend, OAuth) and required environment variables
